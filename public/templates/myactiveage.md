# Proposal MyActiveAge: AI-Powered Longevity Engine

## **1. Executive Summary**

Following our detailed conversations, we created a proposal that outlines a phased plan to build the **MyActiveAge AI-Powered Longevity Engine**.

The vision is to develop a sophisticated AI **co-pilot** for your expert team.

We have streamlined the build into a modular **8 weeks Project Scope**. This plan prioritizes the modules with the highest immediate impact, beginning with the **AI Findings Generator** and immediately followed by the **AI Action Plan Generator**. This sequence delivers the core physician co-pilot first, automating the heavy lifting of drafting both the analysis and the corresponding personalized plan.

This will be followed by the two-part **Consult & Intake Recording AI**, designed to intelligently capture and structure the crucial data from client conversations.

This approach provides a clear, manageable path to launching your AI capabilities, delivering immediate ROI by solving key operational bottlenecks, and building a powerful, proprietary asset for MyActiveAge.

## **2. Guiding principles**

We identified these important core principles:

* **Human-in-the-Loop is Paramount:** Every AI-generated draft, from findings to action plans, is designed for physician review. The AI acts as an expert assistant, providing a robust first draft that your team will always have the final say on, ensuring quality, safety, and a personal touch.
* **Build a Compounding Asset:** Every module is designed to contribute to an **Intelligent Knowledge Base**. We will meticulously structure all generated data‚Äîfrom findings to consultation summaries‚Äîto ensure it enriches the AI's understanding, making each subsequent module more powerful and valuable with time. **We will begin building this foundational asset from day one of Module 1.**


* **Capture All Value:** We will automate the capture of critical information from consultations, turning unstructured conversations into structured, actionable data and fulfilling all mandatory `verslaglegging` (summary log) requirements.
* **Scale Hyper-Personalization:** We will move beyond generic advice by architecting an AI that leverages the rich knowledge base to personalize the very **content and tone within each action card**.

## **3. Project Scope: A Phased Roadmap**

We propose a modular development plan to build and launch the foundational AI engine, prioritized based on our strategic discussion to maximize immediate impact.
