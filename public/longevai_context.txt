## **‚öôÔ∏è 4. Internal Operations & The LongevAI Playbook**

Efficiency, transparency, and cutting-edge technology are the pillars of LongevAI's internal operations.

### **4.1. The Client Journey SOP**

LongevAI follows a transparent, six-step process for all AI integration, consultancy, and workshop projects:

1.  **Initial Discovery:** A 60-90 minute workshop to map pain points and prioritize AI opportunities.
2.  **Proposal Creation:** Delivery of an interactive proposal with high-level slides and detailed module breakdowns.
3.  **Refinement & Contract:** Revisions based on client feedback and contract signing.
4.  **Weekly Progress:** 30-minute syncs with live demos and client Q&A. This step is repeated for each module.
5.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Formal client validation and sign-off at the end of each module.
6.  **Future Opportunities:** A post-implementation review to identify new use cases and roadmap future phases.

### **4.2. Development Workflow & Guidelines**

LongevAI employs a sophisticated, AI-augmented development workflow designed for speed, quality, and scalability.

*   **Core Philosophy:** üß† **Architecture First, Code Second.** A flawless, detailed plan is created using AI *before* writing code to minimize bugs and technical debt.
*   **The AI Planning Phase (Phase 1):**
    *   **Tool:** Google's **AI Studio** is used for its massive context window.
    *   **Process:** The entire codebase is provided as context. The developer states a high-level goal and uses a critical prompt: *"Ask me all the relevant questions first that you need to make the best possible solution."*
    *   **Output:** This dialogue results in a bulletproof, step-by-step implementation plan or, for backends, a complete set of well-architected files.
*   **The Development Loop (Phase 2):**
    *   **Tools:** AI-powered editors like **Claude Code** (terminal-based) or **Cursor** (visual IDE).
    *   **Process:** The plan from AI Studio is handed off to the AI Coder for precise execution.
    *   **Environment:** Development is standardized using **Docker** and a **Makefile** for one-command setup (`make setup`, `make run-dev`), ensuring consistency for every developer.
*   **The Quality Gates (Phase 3):**
    *   **Automated Review:** When a Pull Request (PR) is opened on GitHub, **Gemini** is automatically added as a reviewer. It analyzes every line of code for bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and best practice deviations.
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop:** The developer uses an AI Coder to apply Gemini's suggestions. A human reviewer then focuses on high-level architecture and business logic before merging. The reviewer is always the one to merge the code.

### **4.3. Team & Communication**

*   **Team Structure:**
    *   **Cosmina Druica:** CEO (Business Development, Client Relations)
    *   **Elio Verhoef:** CTO (Technical Lead, Project Owner)
    *   **Bart Hordijk:** Sales & Business Development
    *   **Marketing:** Ankita Kabir
    *   **Developers:** Diogo Leal, Catalin Niculescu, Harshit Kedia, and Vladislavs Sokolovs.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Slack:** Primary tool for daily internal and client communication.
    *   **Fibery:** Central hub for project management, documentation, and SOPs.
    *   **Fathom / Tactiq:** AI tools for recording, transcribing, and summarizing virtual meetings.
*   **Onboarding:** A comprehensive process is in place, covering general company culture, role-specific checklists (Developer, Sales, Project Manager), and technical exercises.

## **üìà 5. Client Projects & Case Studies**

This section details LongevAI's work with various clients, showcasing their expertise across different industries and solutions.

### **5.1. Qualevita Clinic (Longevity & Healthcare)**

A flagship project to build a transformative AI-powered system for automating and enhancing the patient consultation process for a premier longevity clinic.

*   **Challenge:** Qualevita's doctors conduct deep, multi-hour consultations, but the process of documenting findings, creating patient plans, and writing prescriptions was entirely manual, time-consuming, and inefficient.
*   **Solution: The Consultation Automation System:** LongevAI built a secure, GDPR-compliant web platform with:
    *   **AI Medical Transcription:** Real-time, high-accuracy transcription of consultations (Dutch & English) using Google Vertex AI, with a custom vocabulary for medical terms. Audio files are deleted immediately after processing for privacy.
    *   **Automated Report Generation:** The AI processes the transcript to automatically populate Qualevita's bespoke templates, including a comprehensive 5-pillar patient health program and a structured prescription list.
    *   **Interactive Editing:** A branded doctor interface allows for manual edits and a powerful AI Chat Assistant for voice or text commands (e.g., *"Increase Eutirox to 75mcg"*).
    *   **Data Privacy by Design:** A "Redaction-in-Transit" strategy ensures client names are replaced with a `[CLIENT_NAME]` placeholder *before* being sent to the LLM, making the data anonymous during processing.
*   **Technical Architecture:** A modern serverless stack hosted in Frankfurt, Germany, using Koyeb (Backend), MongoDB Atlas (Database), and Managed Redis (Task Queue). The architecture is designed to be highly scalable and cost-efficient, with an initial operating cost of only **~‚Ç¨13/month**.
*   **Outcome:** A game-changing tool that drastically reduces administrative burden, allowing clinicians to focus entirely on the patient. The project serves as the foundation for a future "Knowledge Base" to unlock deeper insights from patient data.

### **5.2. Medio Zorg (Healthcare Recruitment)**

A project to build and enhance an intelligent, two-sided recruitment platform to disrupt the traditional, commission-based healthcare hiring model.

*   **Challenge:** The existing platform struggled with low candidate onboarding and client adoption. The manual recruitment process was not scalable.
*   **Solution: The Medio Zorg Platform & Strategic Pivot:**
    *   **AI Matching Engine:** An advanced system that matches candidates to vacancies based on a detailed, weighted score across categories like function, specialization, and distance.
    *   **Automated CV Parsing:** The system automatically extracts structured data from uploaded CVs to enrich candidate profiles.
    *   **Strategic Pivot to "Medio Punt":** When the initial model faced sales hurdles, LongevAI collaborated on a strategic pivot to a **joint venture with "Arbo" (Martin)**. The project involves creating a white-labeled HR platform for Arbo, funded by them, with a 50/50 revenue split. This shifts the focus from a direct-to-market SaaS to a powerful B2B partnership.
    *   **AI-Powered Data Import:** To overcome costly API integrations with HR systems like AFAS/Cobra, LongevAI proposed a smarter solution: an AI module that can read and structure data from standard **Excel or PDF exports**, making data import cheaper, faster, and universally compatible.
*   **Outcome:** A modern recruitment platform poised to reduce hiring costs and increase efficiency for healthcare organizations, with a newly defined, high-potential go-to-market strategy.

### **5.3. MyActiveAge (Longevity & Preventative Health)**

A strategic partnership to build an AI co-pilot for MyActiveAge's team of physicians and coaches, designed to scale the delivery of hyper-personalized longevity advice.

*   **Challenge:** The manual process of analyzing client test data (blood, urine, VO2max) and creating personalized "Findings" and "Action Plans" was a major bottleneck, limiting scalability.
*   **Solution: The AI-Powered Longevity Engine (Phased Rollout):**
    *   **Module 1: AI Findings Generator:** The highest priority module automates the first draft of domain-specific health summaries by synthesizing lab results, client profiles, and a curated knowledge base (e.g., Peter Attia's principles).
    *   **Module 2: AI Action Plan Generator:** Creates personalized action plans with intervention "cards" (Nutrition, Sleep, etc.). The AI personalizes the content *within* the cards based on the client's specific data and goals.
    *   **Module 3 & 4: Intake & Consult Recording AI:** A system to record, transcribe, and summarize client consultations, automatically suggesting profile updates and fulfilling mandatory `verslaglegging` (summary log) requirements.
    *   **Module 5: The Longevity Assistant:** A client-facing chatbot fully aware of the client's personal data, allowing them to ask questions about their plan and update their profile via chat.
*   **IP Agreement:** A crucial decision was made upfront: MyActiveAge retains **100% IP ownership** of the final delivered code, a key requirement for their long-term company valuation.
*   **Outcome:** A clear, modular roadmap to build a powerful, proprietary AI asset that enhances physician efficiency and enables the scaling of hyper-personalized care.

### **5.4. BetterBrains / BrainThrive (Neurofeedback & Health Optimization)**

A project to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) platform for managing neurofeedback clients and practitioners.

*   **Challenge:** The client, a newly certified practitioner, needed a platform to manage her first cohort of trainees, track their progress, and facilitate supervisor oversight.
*   **Solution: A 6-Week MVP Platform:** The scope was collaboratively defined to deliver maximum value quickly.
    *   **Core Features:** Secure portals for clients, trainers, and supervisors; a system for tracking purchased session packages; and a visual timeline of the client's training journey.
    *   **Key MVP Enhancement:** The most critical feature added during planning was an **interactive, in-platform training plan editor**. This allows supervisors to directly edit and comment on a trainer's plan, solving a major communication bottleneck and making the platform truly "viable."
    *   **Lean Communication:** To save development time, full in-platform chat was postponed. The MVP cleverly uses links to **external WhatsApp groups** for communication.
*   **Outcome:** A well-defined, 6-week roadmap for an MVP that is both lean and highly functional, addressing the most critical user needs from day one.

### **5.5. MediCapital Solutions (Equipment Financing)**

An AI project to automate lead generation and qualification for a company providing financing for medical and sustainability equipment.

*   **Challenge:** The client was operating at only 20% capacity due to a lack of marketing and sales activity, struggling to find new leads and penetrate new markets.
*   **Solution: The AI-Powered Lead Engine:**
    *   **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Workshop:** LongevAI facilitated a workshop to define concrete ICPs. A key strategic shift was to focus not only on end-users but heavily on **suppliers and distributors** as a high-leverage sales channel.
    *   **AI Discovery & Enrichment:** The system continuously scans the internet to discover new leads matching the ICPs. It then enriches these leads with data from KVK (Chamber of Commerce) and location information.
    *   **Dashboard & Workflow:** A simple dashboard presents the qualified leads, which can then be exported to HubSpot. The tool is designed as a powerful discovery and qualification engine, not a full CRM.
*   **Outcome:** A clear plan to build an automated system that fills the sales pipeline with high-quality leads, saving the sales team significant time and enabling strategic market expansion.

### **5.6. V&P Vastgoed (Real Estate)**

An AI solution to automate tenant communication and issue resolution via a WhatsApp-based chatbot.

*   **Challenge:** The property management company was spending significant manual effort handling tenant issues reported via WhatsApp and email, from leakages to heating problems.
*   **Solution: The V&P Vastgoed Technical Support Bot:**
    *   **Automated Triage:** The WhatsApp bot initiates a dialogue with tenants to gather details about an issue (what, where, when, photos).
    *   **Guided Troubleshooting:** For common issues like low boiler pressure, the bot provides step-by-step guides and videos to empower tenants to solve the problem themselves.
    *   **Intelligent Escalation:** If troubleshooting fails, the bot collects all information into a neat summary and forwards it to the property manager (Carmen), who can then dispatch a technician.
    *   **Knowledge Integration:** The bot uses a knowledge base of property-specific rules (e.g., "dishwashers are the tenant's responsibility") to provide accurate information.
*   **Outcome:** A proposal for a 6-week project to deliver a smart automation solution that improves tenant satisfaction, reduces manual workload, and streamlines issue resolution.
