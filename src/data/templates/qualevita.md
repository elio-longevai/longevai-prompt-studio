# Consultation Automation System Proposal - Qualevita

## **1. Executive Overview**

Following our insightful discussion on April 24th, LongevAI is excited to propose a focused **Consultation Automation System** for Qualevita Clinic. We understand that your immediate priority is to implement a practical AI solution that directly addresses the challenges of capturing and utilizing the extensive information generated during your in-depth, multi-hour doctor consultations.

This system is designed specifically to transform valuable consultation dialogues into structured, actionable intelligence, effectively bridging the gap between conversation and concrete patient plans. It will:
* **Accurately Capture & Transcribe** lengthy doctor consultations (supporting Dutch and English).
* **Intelligently Structure Key Information** based on your established consultation flow (e.g., anamnesis, lab analysis, diagnostics, plan).
* **Automatically Generate Essential Outputs** by populating *your specific Qualevita templates* – including structured reports for internal use, clear patient summaries, and detailed health programs with supplement/medication prescription details.

Our approach prioritizes delivering immediate value through a secure, GDPR-compliant system hosted on approved servers. The user interface will be **Qualevita-branded**, ensuring a professional experience. We aim to deliver a solution that, as Peer noted, will be **"game-changing"** for Qualevita.

## **2. Expected Impact**

Implementing the Qualevita Consultation Automation System will deliver significant, tangible benefits:
* ✅ **Eliminate Hours of Manual Documentation:** Drastically reduce the time spent manually transcribing, summarizing, and structuring notes after each 4-5 hour consultation.
* ✅ **Ensure Consistent, High-Quality Documentation:** Standardize the format and detail captured across all patient records.
* ✅ **Create Actionable Health Programs Faster:** Automatically generate draft health programs and supplement lists directly from the doctor's recommendations during the consultation.
* ✅ **Unlock Valuable Insights:** Collect consultation reports over time, allowing to analyze and identify trends in the future.
* ✅ **Enhance Patient Experience:** Provide patients with clear, professional, branded summaries and actionable plans derived directly from their consultation.
* ✅ **Improve Internal Workflows:** Streamline the process for Frank and the team to access and utilize structured consultation data.
* ✅ **Longevity Knowledge Base**: Build the methodology and knowledge base foundation for a digital twin of a longevity doctor
* ✅ **Maintain Full Compliance:** Operate within a secure, GDPR-compliant framework with controlled data access.

This system directly addresses the core challenge of converting the richness of doctor-patient interaction into efficient, usable outputs, freeing up valuable time and enhancing the quality of care delivery.

## **3. Project Scope (6 Weeks Total)**

This project focuses on delivering the Consultation Automation System in two sequential 3-week modules.

**Module 1: Core Automation Engine (3 Weeks)**
| **Feature** | **Description** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Medical Transcription** | Integration with a specialized, GDPR-compliant medical transcription API optimized for Dutch & English to process consultation recordings. | Critical |
| **Automated Template Filling** | AI engine trained to extract relevant information from transcripts and automatically populate the **Qualevita templates** (e.g. prescription template) | Critical |
| **Branded Doctor Interface** | A simple, web-based interface with Qualevita branding for doctors/staff to review, edit, and approve the AI-generated initial templates. | High |
| **AI-Chat for Refinement** | An integrated AI chat feature allowing users to interactively discuss, query, and refine the transcript-generated content within the generated template (e.g., "Decrease the dosage of eutirox to 25mcg" inside a prescription template). The templates are manually editable too. | High |

**Module 2: Enhanced Reporting & Refinement (3 Weeks)**
| **Feature** | **Description** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Report Generation** | Automated creation of comprehensive patient reports and summaries based on the consultation data. Generated reports can be edited with the chat. These are to be generated using AI directly after the transcript is finished being generated. We should be able to switch between reports for each patient. | High |
| **Visual Health Indicators** | Implementation of a visual system (e.g., Red/Orange/Green) within the biomarker analysis to quickly convey key health status aspects. | Medium |
| **EPD Integration Prep** | Ensuring the output data is structured in a format suitable for potential future integration with an Electronic Patient Dossier (EPD) system. Clinic Minds. | Medium |
| **System Refinement** | Iterative improvements to transcription accuracy, template filling quality, and overall system based on Qualevita feedback from Module 1 usage. | High |
| **Knowledge Base Creation** | The insights gathered from the transcribed consultations will be systematically organized into a structured knowledge base foundation. This knowledge base will consolidate three key data types from the consultation automation system: (1) transcribed consultation recordings, (2) populated Qualevita templates (including prescription templates), and (3) generated patient reports and summaries (including health programs/protocols).  By organizing these consultation-derived resources, the team will establish the foundational structure for a comprehensive knowledge repository that captures the consultation methodologies and treatment approaches documented during this project phase. This foundation will support future development of the digital twin capabilities while remaining focused on the current project deliverables. | High |

*Note: Qualevita is responsible for providing the recording device (microphone); LongevAI can provide recommendations.*
